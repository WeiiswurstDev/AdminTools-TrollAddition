# AdminTools - TrollAddition
This Minecraft Bukkit/Spigot/Paper plugin is an addition to my 
[AdminTools3 Plugin](https://github.com/WeiiswurstDev/AdminTools3)

This means that you have to install AdminTools3 AND this addition to use the modules in here.

I made this plugin for 2 reasons:
* You can troll your players with it
* I can demonstrate how to integrate into AdminTools3
