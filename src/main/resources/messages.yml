### This is the message file for AdminTrollAdditions.
### You can change any settings in here.
### Unlike AdminTools3, things that you write in here will NOT get overwritten.
### Because AdminTrolls uses the same MessageTranslator as AdminTools3, PlaceholderAPI and all other features will work fine here as well.
###
### How to configure: https://github.com/WeiiswurstDev/AdminTools3/wiki/Configuring-AdminTools3
### (although this guides you through the AdminTools3-config as well, everything said about modules in there is true.)
### (Only one thing is different: This file will NOT get replaced on startup! you can change it however you like!)
